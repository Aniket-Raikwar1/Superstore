📊 Key Analyses & Insights
1️⃣ Customer Segmentation: New vs. Existing Customers
We classify customers as "New" or "Existing" based on their first purchase. This helps businesses track customer retention rates and understand if customers are returning due to brand loyalty or discounts.

2️⃣ Sales & Profit Analysis
By grouping data by Order ID, we calculate:
✔ Total sales per order
✔ Total profit per order
✔ Number of items per order

This analysis highlights top-performing products and loss-making categories.

3️⃣ Impact of Discounts on Profitability
Discounts attract customers, but are they profitable? We analyze how high-discount products affect total profit and whether excessive discounts lead to negative profit margins.

4️⃣ Shipping Performance Analysis
Using shipping time calculations, we evaluate:
✔ Fastest & slowest shipping methods
✔ Average shipping delays
✔ Impact of shipping time on returns

This helps businesses optimize logistics and improve customer satisfaction.

5️⃣ Yearly Trends & Customer Growth
We track new customer acquisition each year to see if customer growth is improving or declining. If growth slows down, businesses may need better marketing strategies.

🎯 Business Impact
This analysis helps businesses:
✔ Improve customer retention strategies
✔ Optimize pricing & discount policies
✔ Enhance shipping efficiency
✔ Identify high-value customers for targeted marketing

🔥 Conclusion
The Superstore Sales Analysis provides valuable insights into sales trends, profitability, customer behavior, and shipping efficiency. Businesses can use these insights to make data-driven decisions and improve overall performance.
